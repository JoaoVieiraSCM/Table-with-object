# Table-with-object
In this file, I simulated data insertion, transforming it into an object. With this object I placed it in localStorage to save it, then I inserted the data into the table coming directly from what was inside localStorage.


In the near future, I would like to add more functionalities to this page, as: Confirmation to delete a student, download .JSON with all objects saved in your device and the possibility to edit a student.


PS: This works is not accessible to everyone and not even responsive!
